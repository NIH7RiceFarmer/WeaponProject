GOAL: My project is about detecting weapons to increase the safety of the general public.

DATASET: The dataset I used is called "Dangerous Object Dataset" https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alinadilawaiz/dangerous-objects-dataset

PROCESS:
1. Through the ID Tech Gameplan, I was taught the basics of python, linux, and visual code studio. Along with this, I learned the skills necessary to download datasets and how to train them.
2. Once these necessary skills were acquired, I downloaded my first dataset (There was an error in it), which led me to my second one (which lacked a variety of weapons), and then I ended up on my final dataset
3. In total I trained and retrained it about five times because the results the training was giving me were inconsistant. I believe the problem was the dataset's trainingn images themselves as the wrong class kept being assigned to the wrong item. For instance, it assigned the "Handgun" class to a rifle
4. The final project currently remains unfinished, but I have gotten it to successfully identify rifles on a semi-consistant level.
